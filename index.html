<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I am an engineer with a passion for the future. I wish to see clean and lucid technology guiding the world's vector of change toward the long-term greatest good of humanity. I have a deep interest in the architecture of complex systems and facilitating emergence. I value foresight, innovation, multidimensional thinking, and appropriate application of technology. I am existentially intolerant of the status quo.</p>
<p>My current professional interests include building tools for community self-organization, including tools for identity, trust, collaboration, annotation, and discovery. I'm fascinated with application and data ecosystems, and would like to see more flexibility and crossover between systems. Other interests include human-computer interaction, appropriate technology, sustainable development, open source everything, mountain biking, snow sports, and meditation.</p>
<p>I bring 10+ years of industry experience. My ideal workplace has a vibrant environment of innovation, a strong team practicing Agile methodologies, and a culture of excellence. It is more than a day job, it is a platform to launch big ideas. I have played many roles over the years, and am open to the right job, whatever form that takes.
