<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<p>“Jack is an exceptional engineer and leader. He strives to deeply
understand the technology he’s working on while remaining cognizant of
the socio-technical components that may be a factor in any project. He’s
thorough, detail-oriented, and outcome-oriented, which means the
solutions he architects, builds, and collaborates on come out better.
Jack also strives to be at the forefront of new technology and assess
how he can leverage it. Newer tech like GenAI can be complex and
ever-evolving, and Jack is not one to back down but step up and embrace.
He does all this with a strong team mentality, is a phenomenal team
player, and can effectively delegate to help lift others’ skill
sets.”</p>
<h5 id="brandon-clifford-director-of-devops-kantata">Brandon Clifford,
Director of DevOps, Kantata</h5>
<p>“Jack is a fantastic engineer always ready to help solve problems and
more importantly, teach you how to solve them. He guided me and my team
through a bunch of challenging gitops situations with patience and
kindness, leading by example. Always diligent with his work, willing to
roll up his sleeves to get things done and find creative solutions,
maybe tinkering in some kind of script that would make the manual
processes easier and more resilient. Everyone would be lucky to have
someone like him in their teams!”</p>
<h5 id="cesar-palafox-garza-principal-software-engineer-kantata">Cesar
Palafox Garza, Principal Software Engineer, Kantata</h5>
<p>“Jack has had quite a profound impact on my career. As a young
engineer, I was fortunate enough to work with Jack as my coach. He
served as a great mentor, helping me build both technical and
professional skills and forming me into the engineer that I am today.
Throughout our time together, Jack was caring and invested in helping me
set goals and develop my career. His mentorship was a key factor in
elevating myself from an incoming Junior Engineer to an Engineering
Manager. Jack has a great curiosity and a strong set of technical
capabilities that allow him to serve as a great example for others and a
key contributor to any team!”</p>
<h5 id="wesley-morlock-engineering-manager-kantata">Wesley Morlock,
