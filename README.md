Please feel free to use this simple publishing tool for your own documents. Simply edit resume.md
to your liking, and run the `publish` script to generate doc, odt and pdf versions. You'll need to
adapt the `publish` script if you want to use it on files that are named something other than
"resume".

Requirements
------------

- pandoc
- libreoffice (Ubuntu users should install `libreoffice-common`)
