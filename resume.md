Introduction
------------

*Software engineer with strong people and management skills, seeking a lead developer or
engineering manager role.*

As an engineer I care deeply about quality, detail and precision, not only at the code level but
throughout the product. I temper my perfectionism with a relentless drive to ship, because a product
is only as good as its usefulness to actual people.

As a leader I bring empathy, warmth, and clarity of communication. I stick to the goal at hand while
holding the big picture.

I enjoy creating lucid user experiences, designing robust software architectures, and optimizing
operations and processes.

I'm seeking a vibrant environment of innovation, a strong team practicing Agile methodologies, and a
culture of excellence. It is more than a day job, it is a platform for ideas and innovation at the
global level.
