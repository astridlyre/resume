Recommendations
---------------

"Jack is an exceptional engineer and leader. He strives to deeply understand the technology he's
working on while remaining cognizant of the socio-technical components that may be a factor in any
project. He's thorough, detail-oriented, and outcome-oriented, which means the solutions he
architects, builds, and collaborates on come out better. Jack also strives to be at the forefront of
new technology and assess how he can leverage it. Newer tech like GenAI can be complex and
ever-evolving, and Jack is not one to back down but step up and embrace. He does all this with a
strong team mentality, is a phenomenal team player, and can effectively delegate to help lift
others' skill sets."  

##### Brandon Clifford, Director of DevOps, Kantata

"Jack is a fantastic engineer always ready to help solve problems and more importantly, teach you
how to solve them. He guided me and my team through a bunch of challenging gitops situations with
patience and kindness, leading by example. Always diligent with his work, willing to roll up his
sleeves to get things done and find creative solutions, maybe tinkering in some kind of script that
would make the manual processes easier and more resilient. Everyone would be lucky to have someone
like him in their teams!"  

##### Cesar Palafox Garza, Principal Software Engineer, Kantata

"Jack has had quite a profound impact on my career. As a young engineer, I was fortunate enough to
work with Jack as my coach. He served as a great mentor, helping me build both technical and
professional skills and forming me into the engineer that I am today. Throughout our time together,
Jack was caring and invested in helping me set goals and develop my career. His mentorship was a key
factor in elevating myself from an incoming Junior Engineer to an Engineering Manager. Jack has a
great curiosity and a strong set of technical capabilities that allow him to serve as a great
example for others and a key contributor to any team!"

there is anything that can be done through web development, Jack can figure out how to do it, and
