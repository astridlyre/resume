Introduction
------------

My ideal workplace has a vibrant environment of innovation, a strong team practicing Agile
methodologies, and a culture of excellence. It is more than a day job, it is a platform to launch
big ideas. I bring 10 years of industry experience, an appetite for challenges, and a broad
understanding of the technological landscape.

I am an engineer with a passion for humanity. I wish to build lucid technology to help navigate
the rapid changes lying ahead. To that end I have a deep interest in architecture of [emergent
systems][], open infrastructure, and tools that facilitate collaboration, communication, and
education. I value foresight, innovation, multidimensional thinking, and appropriate application
of technology. I am existentially intolerant of the status quo.

D3, PHP, ActionScript, Flex, and SuperCollider. Limited experience with C/C++, Java, Perl and
